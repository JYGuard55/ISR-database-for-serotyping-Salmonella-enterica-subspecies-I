# ISR-database-for-serotyping-Salmonella-enterica-subspecies-I
The dkgB-linked intergenic sequence ribotype (ISR) region of Salmonella enterica subspecies I can be used to screen for serotype. The ISR database is reviewed by BLAST in comparison to NCBI complete and draft genomes, which respectively had approximately 662 and 7,900 genomes as of end of March 2018. It was developed by triangulation with Kauffman-White-LeMinor antisera based typing and DNA microarray hybridization that is AOAC approved in Europe. It is being reviewed in comparison to MLST data. This is a screening assay meant to be used for applied testing programs. Data requirements are minimized. USDA makes this available as a democratized assay having applied value for protecting the safety of the food supply, and thus should be made widely available. It will be updated periodically.
